      My favorite hobbie sports.It is wonderfull and so intresting.It is an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.There are several types of sports, usually divided by four main categories according to the types of skills required: physical sports (swimming, gymnastics), motorised sports (these often involve vehicles like cars or motorbikes), mind sports (like chess , which needs a lot of attention and critical thinking skills), and sports with animals </p> </body>
